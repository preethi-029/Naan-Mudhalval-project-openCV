## Peojwct Overview

### 1.Crowd Counting and Density Estimation System

Description: 
     Crowd Counting and Density Estimation systems use computer vision to
estimate the number of people and their spatial distribution in a given area, 
enabling applications in surveillance, public safety, event management, and smart 
cities.
Input:
  1. Images or Video Streams 
       From CCTV, drone footage, or static surveillance cameras in public 
     areas like stadiums, malls, streets, or airports.
Output:
  1. Crowd Count 
       Total estimated number of people in the scene (e.g., "Estimated 
      Crowd: 142").

### 2.Underwater Object Detection for Marine Study

Description:
     Underwater Object Detection systems help identify and monitor marine 
life, debris, geological formations, or human-made structures (e.g., pipelines, 
wrecks) for oceanographic research, conservation, and exploration. 

Input:
  1. Underwater Video Feed or Images 
       Captured by underwater cameras on ROVs (Remotely Operated 
     Vehicles), AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles), or divers. 
     RGB, low-light, or sonar imagery.

Output:
  1. Detected Objects 
       Classification and localization of marine species, coral, debris, etc. 
       Bounding boxes or masks with object labels and confidence scores.

### 3.Real-Time Traffic Sign Detection

Description:
     Real-time traffic sign detection analyzes video or image frames captured 
     from a moving vehicle or webcam to identify road signs instantly. It marks
     detected signs with bounding boxes and labels, classifying them into categories like Stop,
     Speed Limit, No Entry, and Traffic Lights.

Input: 
     Live Video Feed or Pre-recorded Video or Image Frame 
     Captured from a camera mounted on a vehicle or a webcam. 
     Typically in RGB image format. 
Output: 
     Detected Traffic Signs (in real time) 
     Traffic sign type (e.g., Stop Sign, Speed Limit, No Entry, Traffic 
     Light Red/Green/Blue). 
     Bounding boxes around detected signs in the video frame. 
     Labels identifying the type of sign.
